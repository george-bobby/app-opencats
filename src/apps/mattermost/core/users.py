            Available users (ONLY use these exact user IDs):

            VALID USER IDS (you MUST only use IDs from this list): {valid_user_ids}
            
            Assignment Rules:
            
            CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA: Every single channel must have at least {min_channel_size} members!
            
            1. **TEAM SIZE TARGETS**:
               - Aim for {min_team_size}-{max_team_size} total users in this team
               - Prefer around {expected_team_size} users for this team
               - Some teams should be larger/smaller than others for realism
               - Consider team purpose when deciding size (Engineering teams can be larger, specialized teams smaller)
            
            2. **MANDATORY CHANNEL CONSTRAINTS** (CRITICAL - MUST BE FOLLOWED):
               - Each channel MUST have EXACTLY between {min_channel_size} and {max_channel_size} members
               - NO EXCEPTIONS: Every channel needs at least {min_channel_size} users assigned
               - Default channels (town-square, off-topic) MUST have {max(min_channel_size * 2, int(expected_team_size * 0.6))} or more members
               - If you cannot assign enough users to meet minimums, assign more users to reach the minimum
               - Better to over-assign than under-assign - active channels are better than empty ones
            
            2. **Role-based assignments**:
               - Developers/Engineers â engineering, tech, development, code channels
               - Accountants/Finance â finance, budget, accounting, financial channels  
               - HR/People â hr, people, culture, employee channels
               - Marketing â marketing, social, content, brand channels
               - Sales â sales, revenue, customer, business channels
               - Support â support, help, customer service, escalation channels
               - Product â product, roadmap, feature, planning channels
               - Operations â operations, process, workflow, logistics channels
            
            4. **Seniority-based access**:
               - Senior positions (Senior, Lead, Principal) â relevant channels + some cross-functional
               - Managers/Directors â department channels as admin + cross-functional as member
               - C-Suite (CEO, CTO, CFO, etc.) â strategic channels as admin + oversight access
               - VPs/Heads â broad departmental access as admin
            
            5. **Cross-functional collaboration**:
               - Include non-department members in relevant channels (PMs in engineering channels, engineers in product channels)
               - Leadership should have access to multiple departments
               - Support and operations staff often participate across teams
               - Company-wide channels (announcements, culture) should include most employees
            
            6. **Channel type considerations**:
               - Private channels ("P") â smaller groups, key stakeholders only (10-30% of users)
               - Public channels ("O") â larger groups, broader access (20-80% of users)
            
            7. **ID VALIDATION**:
               - ONLY use user IDs from the valid list: {valid_user_ids}
               - Do NOT invent or hallucinate user IDs
               - If unsure about a user ID, do NOT include it
            
            8. **Role assignment**:
               - "admin": Managers, Directors, C-Suite, Team Leads in relevant channels
               - "member": Regular team members, cross-functional participants
            
            Return assignments that create realistic, well-distributed teams with proper channel sizes.
