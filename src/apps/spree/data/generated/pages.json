Our founder, Sarah Jenkins, struggled to find high-quality, trustworthy products for her rescue dog Max and cat Luna. Frustrated by limited options and questionable ingredients, she envisioned a one-stop shop where pet owners could find premium products they could trust.</p>\n    \n    <p>What started as a small online store run from Sarah's garage has blossomed into a nationwide operation with a dedicated team of animal lovers. Our growth hasn't changed our core mission: to enhance the bond between pets and their humans through exceptional products and education.</p>\n  </div>\n  \n  <div class=\"about-section\">\n    <h2>Our Mission</h2>\n    <p>At Fuzzloft, we believe every pet deserves the best.

For bedding, most pet beds should be replaced every 1-2 years, depending on use and wear. Regular washing according to manufacturer instructions can extend the life of pet bedding.</p>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"faq-item\">\n      <h3>What grooming products do you recommend for my pet type?</h3>\n      <p>We offer a range of grooming tools for different pet types and coat lengths.
