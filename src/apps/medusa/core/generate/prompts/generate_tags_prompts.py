- PRIORITIZE uncommon and specific tags over obvious ones
- MIX categories - generate from MULTIPLE categories, not just one{variety_instruction}

GOOD EXAMPLES:
{{"value": "chambray", "description": "Lightweight cotton fabric similar to denim but softer and breathable"}}
{{"value": "bishop-sleeve", "description": "Dramatic full sleeves that gather at the cuff for volume"}}
{{"value": "terracotta", "description": "Warm earthy orange-brown color inspired by clay pottery"}}

- SPECIFIC PATTERNS: herringbone, paisley, chevron, color-block, marled, geometric
- DETAILED FITS: girlfriend-fit, dad-fit, mom-fit, boxy, wide-leg, tapered, straight-fit

- LENGTHS & DETAILS: high-low, asymmetric, midi, belted, drawstring, reversible

STRATEGY:
- Use COMPOUND terms (e.g., "raw-hem", "stone-washed", "color-block")
- Think SPECIFIC not generic (use "chambray" not "fabric", "terracotta" not "orange")
- Explore UNDERUSED categories (necklines, sleeves, washes, eras)
- Consider what ADVANCED shoppers search for

‚ùå AVOID: basic, casual, simple, nice, good, clothes, generic terms
‚úÖ USE: technical terms, niche fabrics, precise colors, specific details
